## Paperwork

As this is a Google project, you *must* first e-sign the [Google Contributor License Agreement](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html) before we can accept any code. It takes only a second and basically just says you won't sue us or claim copyright of your submitted code. You only need to do this once for any Google project.
